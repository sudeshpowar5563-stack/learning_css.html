    <p class="para1">The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations which coordinates
        responses to international public health issues and emergencies.[2] It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland,
        and has six regional offices[3] and 150 field offices worldwide. Only sovereign states are eligible to join, and
        it is the largest intergovernmental health organization at the international level.[4]The WHO's purpose is to
        achieve the highest possible level of health for all the world's people, defining health as "a state of complete
        physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."[5] The main
        functions of the World Health Organization include promoting the control of epidemic and endemic diseases;
        providing and improving the teaching and training in public health, the medical treatment of disease, and
        related matters; and promoting the establishment of international standards for biological products.</p>
