    <p class="line_height t_transfrom_capitalize t_decor_under">The Shaniwar Wada was normally the seven-story capital
        building of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire. It was supposed to be made entirely of stone. However, after the
        completion of the base floor or the first story, the people of Satara (the national capital) complained to the
        Chhatrapati Shahu I saying that a stone monument can be sanctioned and built only by the Chhatrapati himself and
        not the Peshwas. Following this, an official letter was written to the Peshwas stating that the remaining
        building had to be made of brick and not stone.</p>
