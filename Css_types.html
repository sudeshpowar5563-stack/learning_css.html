        Shivaji Maharaj was a 17th-century warrior king born in 1630 who founded the Maratha Empire in what is now India. He was the son of Shahaji Bhosale and Jijabai, who instilled in him a strong sense of justice and a desire for self-rule (Swarajya). Shivaji is celebrated for his military prowess, particularly his use of guerrilla warfare, his innovative administration, and his fight against Mughal rule.
